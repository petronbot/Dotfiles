#Petch's dotfiles

##dotfiles

This repo represents the current state of my workspace automation.

I don't move computers often but when I do, it's a massive pain in the butt.

Riding on the coat-tails of some smart people who have been doing this [longer than I have][1] I thought I'd try to streamline my apps, configs and special-snowflake preferences.


##todo

[ ] Include some IRL dotfiles
[ ] Include a symlink script to symlink:
	[ ] /homebrew/Brewfile > ~/Brewfile
	[ ] /iterm/com.googlecode.iterm2.plist > ~/Libaray/Preferences/com.googlecode.iterm2.plist
[x] Include an install script to run:
	[x] /homebrew/install.sh
[ ] Include a bootstrap script to put it all together:
	[ ] Set up symlinks
	[ ] Run installs
